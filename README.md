# Structured Swarming: Dynamic Encirclement **Note: discontinued and incorporated into larger project here: https://github.com/tjards/swarming_sim**This project implements an autonomous, decentralized dynamic encirclement strategy for swarms of vehicles. The strategy requires no human invervention once the target is selected and all vehicles rely on local knowledge only. Each vehicle makes its own decisions about where to go based on its relative position to other vehicles, but the protocol results in a globally stable, evenly-spaced swarm. ## CitingThe code is opensource but, if you reference this work in your own reserach, please cite me.
